# VocabularyOptimizer
Tool to optimize parameters which are used when creating visual vocabularies and transforming images to BoW vectors

## Installation [WIP]

To use the VocabularyOptimizer you need a BoW-Library. The recommended (and adapted FBoW-Version can be found [here](https://github.com/decamargo10/FBoW/tree/changes_for_ba)).
When compiling FBoW pybind is used to create a Python module which has to get imported by the Vocabulary Optimizer.


## Usage [WIP]

The VocabularyOptimizer can be used to optimize Vocabularies based on specific input data. This section explains the workflow to generate a optimized Vocabulary.

### Preparing the data

### Setting parameters

### Setting up the evaluation module
